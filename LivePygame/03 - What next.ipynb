In 2013, some sponsors proposed money for the best open source 2D pixel art people could deliver and organized the Liberated Pixel Cup. As a result we got a huge stash of graphics we are free to use. This tool is one of the consequences of that.\n",

They are not the same size as the original [walk](art/LPC/walk.png) sheet so we will need to do some adaptations. Let's first separate the image loading from the `__init__` function and then let's find the good coordinates for these sheets."
